- How to Decide When to Use pin and scrub?
Use pin when: You want an element to stay in one place for a while, even as the user scrolls. It’s great for things like:

Fixing a heading to the top of the screen.
Making a section or image stay visible longer while other content moves past it.
Use scrub when: You want the speed of the scroll to control the animation. It’s perfect for animations that should feel interactive, like:

A car moving across the screen as you scroll.
An image zooming in or out based on how fast or slow you scroll.
How to Choose the scrub Value:
scrub: true: The animation will be tied directly to the scroll, moving smoothly as you scroll.
scrub: <number>: Adding a number (like scrub: 1 or scrub: 2) makes the animation lag behind the scroll by that number of seconds. It creates a delayed effect.
Tip for scrub:
Use scrub: true if you want the animation to follow the scroll exactly.
Use scrub: <number> if you want a more relaxed effect, where the animation trails behind the scroll.
